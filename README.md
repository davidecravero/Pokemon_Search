## Pokemon_Search

#Pokemon Search - The Exercise:

For this exercise we have a react application that takes a number. When this number is submitted, an API call is made to find the pokemon associated with that number. When the pokemon is returned it is stored in state and displayed to the user. If there is an error with the request (maybe there is no associated pokemon) an error message is stored in state and displayed to the user.
Your task is to write the fetch request that will retrieve the pokemon and store it to state or store the error if no pokemon is found.
Here is the url you must use for that fetch request:
